 Develop a Mobile Application for Food Delivery
 This project simulates a basic food ordering app inspired by Baemin, featuring restaurant browsing, menu viewing, dish selection with quantities, cart management, and order placement. With Google Maps integration, users can set or save delivery addresses easily. It is built using Java, JavaScript, SQLite, and Android Studio.
